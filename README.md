# Travel Agency APP UI

Travel Agency App UI developed using flutter.

## Details

This is a modern Travel agency app ui. With flutter I developed a pixel perfect UI.
In the UI there are two pages included. One is the homepage and other one is of the Itinerary option.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="flex: 0 33%; max-width: 250px;">
    <img src="./project_ui/developed/homePage.png" alt="Home Page" >
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 0 33%; max-width: 250px;">
    <img src="./project_ui/developed/secondPage.png" alt="Second Page" >
  </div>
</div>

<style>
  @media (max-width: 500px) {
    div > div {
      flex: 0 0 100% !important;
      max-width: 90% !important;
      justify-content: center;
    }
  }
</style>
